A quick list of things that need to be done.

- Find or create a Markdown Qt parser to HTML (update/package descriptions use Markdown)
  (Daniel)

- Ddd the "Uninstall" action to kickoff :D
  (Daniel)

- Push KPK into KDE.
  (Daniel)

- Documentation. And lots of it.
  (Trever, Daniel)

- Poke Richard (PackageKit) to:
  - Don't emit restartRequired while simulating
  - Don't emit message while simulating
  - Emit trust needed when simulating install
  - We need to emit packages(UNTRUSTED) so the user knows which ones

- Add a DBus interface to KpkTransactions so that when the user
  clicks on the systray we don't get duplicated windows
